      "The multi_map_ebunch function is designed to query the CoCoMac server for data from several parcellation schemes.  The first argument to the function is a string specifying whether mapping or connectivity information is desired.  The second argument, which is optional, specifies which brain maps should be queried; if no argument is given, data is sought for all brain maps in CoCoMac.  CoCoTools includes two constants that are useful second arguments to multi_map_ebunch: MAPPING_SOURCES is a list of those maps for which Mapping data have been entered into CoCoMac, and CONNECTIVITY_SOURCES is the corresponding list for maps with Connectivity data.\n",

Brain maps whose queries are known to cause CoCoMac server timeouts are listed in the CoCoTools constants MAPPING_TIMEOUTS and CONNECTIVITY_TIMEOUTS. These brain maps can be queried separately using the \"query_maps_by_area\" function.\n",

An additional numeric code, 18, is included for CoCoMac data entries without a PDC.  In CoCoTools, lesser PDCs are valued more highly than greater ones.

Within a single map, the level of resolution with the most reported anatomical connections (in ConGraph) is kept.  In the event of a tie, the finer level of resolution is kept except in the case of the target map for ORT ('PHT00' below), for which the coarser level is kept.  This bias maximizes the translatability of information between maps during ORT.  When levels are discarded, areas are removed from both the MapGraph and its corresponding ConGraph, but, when possible, relational and connectivity information for the discarded levels are retained in the one that is kept."
